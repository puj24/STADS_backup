The organization of the CoRTOS directory is as follows:
* codefiles
	build.sh
	config.yaml
	main.c
	main.results
	run.sh
	* INPUTS

* testcases
	* SIS_run_13
	* subsequent directories should be added accordingly 
	
* OUTPUTS
	SIS_run_13.txt
	subsequent files should be added accordingly
	
1. "codefiles" contains all files oraganised in a way so that it is ready to run on CoRTOS	

2. "testcases" contains the all the test cases of the Estimation Algorithm for different runs of the Star Image Simulation Model

3. "OUTPUTS" contains the CoRTOS output for all testcases in the particular run of Star Image Simulation Model
